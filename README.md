## 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This project was built to provide users with strong passwords that provide greater security for accessing sensitive data. The password generator prompts users to select different character types for additional strength, ensures that the password is the optimal length, and generates a password meeting the user's selected criteria in the appropriate box.
